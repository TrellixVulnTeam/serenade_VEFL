      <P>
        Today, we're excited to continue expanding the Serenade ecosystem with first-class support
        for even more languages: C#, Rust, Go, and Ruby. That brings the total to{" "}
        <Link to="/plugins">15 languages</Link> across your favorite developer tools.
      </P>
      <P>
        To use any of these new languages, just open up a file in your editor of choice, and start
        using the Serenade commands you already know. For instance, you can create a C# class with
        "add class", delete a Go function with "delete function", or change a Ruby parameter with
        "change parameter". We've updated our <Link to="/docs">documentation</Link> to include
        examples from all our new languages so you can get up and running quickly.
      </P>
      <P>
        We've also brought some exciting new changes to the Serenade UI. We heard consistently from
        our community that more options to use Serenade in a minimized state were a must, so we've
        streamlined the UI to make sure you can foucs on what's most importantâ€”your code. And, we've
        made our voice activity detection more accurate and customizable, so you can tune Serenade
        to exactly your speaking pace and microphone sensitivity.
      </P>
      <P>
        Finally, we've enhanced our speech-to-code engine to understand more natural vocalizations
        of Serenade commands. Rather than needing to say precise commands like "add function hello",
        you can now describe operations in a wider variety of ways, like "create a function called
        hello" or "delete the next two parameters". Of course, you can continue using the commands
        you've already learned and the custom commands you've already created without any changes.

      </P>
      <P>
        Writing C#, Rust, Go, and Ruby code with voice is now easier than ever. We're excited to see
        what you create! Check out the <Link to="/community">Serenade community</Link> to share what
        you've built and connect with other voice coders.
