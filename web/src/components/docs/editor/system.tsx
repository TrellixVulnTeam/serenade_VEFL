      Serenade doesn't just work for applications that have a native Serenade pluginâ€”you can control
      any application with voice using Serenade. No matter what application you're using, you can
      use commands like <Transcript text="system" /> to insert text, <Transcript text="press" /> to
      press keys (to trigger shortcuts), and <Transcript text="focus" /> to switch apps.

    <p>
      Serenade uses a combination of plugins and OS-level accessibility APIs to manipulate text no
      matter what application you're using. However, some applications don't properly implement
      accessibility APIs, and so Serenade can't read their text fields. When you're using one of
      these applications, you can use Serenade's Revision Box to format your text. Inside of the
      Revision Box, all of Serenade's commands will work properly, and when you're done, Serenade
      can copy the text in the Revision Box back into the application you had focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revision Box will open automatically when Serenade can't read the current field (if
      enabled in settings). You can also say <Transcript text="revision box" /> to open the revision
      box yourself. Or, say <Transcript text="edit" /> to copy the current text field into the
      revision box.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Revision Box is open, you can say <Transcript text="close" /> to close and and ts
      contents into the field you were editing. You can also say <Transcript text="enter" /> to also
      press enter after inserting (e.g., for sending a message) or <Transcript text="copy" /> to
      copy the text to the clipboard rather than inserting it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Serenade has a few different configurable modes to change how your voice commands are
      interpreted.
    </p>
    <Subsubheading title="Command/Dictate Mode" />
    <p>
      Serenade's default mode is Command Mode. In this mode, if you say something that isn't a valid
      Serenade command, Serenade will show an x next to the command and won't do anything. To enable
      command mode, just say <Transcript text="command mode" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, like when dictating a longer block of text, you want Serenade to simply type out
      everything you're saying, rather than listen for other commands. Serenade's Dictate Mode does
      just that. To enable Dictate Mode, just say <Transcript text="dictate mode" />, and then
      Serenade will type out everything you say, rather than listening for valid commands. Some
      commands, like <Transcript text="undo" />, <Transcript text="repeat" />, and
      <Transcript text="stop listening" />, will also be presented as alternatives so you don't have
      to leave Dictate Mode to use them. To get back to normal mode, just say{" "}
      <Transcript text="command mode" />.
    </p>
    <Subsubheading title="Language Modes" />
    <p>
      By default, Serenade will auto-detect which programming language is being used based on your
      editor's filename or active language setting. Sometimes, you might want to override this
      behavior and specify which language Serenade should use. To do so, simply say{" "}
      <Transcript text="python mode" />, <Transcript text="javascript mode" />, and so on. To get
      re-enable auto-detection, say <Transcript text="auto mode" />.
    </p>
